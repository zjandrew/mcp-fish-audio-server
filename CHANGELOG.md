# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- Default `FISH_MODEL_ID` is now `s2-pro` (was `s1`). Override with `FISH_MODEL_ID=s1` to keep the previous model.
- `latency` now accepts `low` in addition to `balanced` and `normal`, matching the current Fish Audio API.

### Added
- New TTS parameters surfaced through the tool schema and request body:
  `opus_bitrate`, `sample_rate`, `normalize_loudness` (s2-pro only),
  `top_p`, `chunk_length`, `max_new_tokens`, `repetition_penalty`,
  `min_chunk_length`, `condition_on_previous_chunks`, `early_stop_threshold`.
- Multi-speaker dialogue (s2-pro only): new `speakers: string[]` tool param.
  Each entry is resolved by id → name → tag against `FISH_REFERENCES`
  (or used as a raw `reference_id` when no references are configured).
  The serialized request sends `reference_id` as an array and your `text`
  drives speaker turns via `<|speaker:0|>`, `<|speaker:1|>`, ... tags.
  Using `speakers` on a non-s2-pro model returns an error.

- Updated FISH_AUTO_PLAY description to clarify it controls both auto-play and real-time playback

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-03

### Breaking Changes
- Removed `FISH_WEBSOCKET_STREAMING` environment variable
- Removed `FISH_REALTIME_PLAY` environment variable

### Changed
- Simplified environment variable configuration
- `websocket_streaming` parameter now defaults to `FISH_STREAMING` value
- `realtime_play` parameter now defaults to `FISH_AUTO_PLAY` value
- Cleaner configuration with unified controls

### Migration Guide
